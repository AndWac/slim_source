Welcome to the mercurial source repository for Slim Install, Dwarf 
Caiman and Snap upgrade. This source also includes the libraries
needed for Caiman.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
To build this repository use the following steps:

 1. cd usr/src in the repository

 2. cp tools/env/developer.sh .; chmod +w developer.sh.

    Change GATE and/or CODEMGR_WS as appropriate.

    You should not need to set the paths for your build tools unless
    you are not using the tools located in /opt/SUNWonbld and /opt/SUNWspro.

 3. Get the SunStudio compilers via the Image Packaging System (IPS). To install 
    run the command "pfexec pkg install sunstudioexpress"

 4. Get the OS/Net Build Tools via the Image Packaging System (IPS). To install
    run the command "pfexec pkg install SUNWonbld"

 5. Copy the nightly build script found in /opt/onbld/bin into the 
    usr/src directory.  

    cp /opt/onbld/bin/nightly .; chmod +w nightly

    In the nightly script there are three places 
    where getopts is called, You need to add a "+" to one or two of them, 
    depending on how you will pass the options to nightly.

    while getopts +inS:tV: FLAG
                  ^
    and

    while getopts +AaBCDdFfGIilMmNnOoPpRrS:TtUuWwXxz FLAG $NIGHTLY_OPTIONS
                  ^

    If you choose not to set these, you will see warning messages 
    regarding building tools. It won't affect your build otherwise.

    To build the source in the repository.
