Welcome to the mercurial source repository for Slim Install, Dwarf 
Caiman and Snap upgrade. This source also includes the libraries
needed for Caiman.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
To build this repository use the following steps:

 1. cd usr/src in the repository

 2. cp tools/env/developer.sh .; chmod +w developer.sh.

    Change GATE and/or CODEMGR_WS as appropriate.

    You should not need to set the paths for your build tools unless
    you are not using the tools located in /opt/SUNWonbld and /opt/SUNWspro.

 3. Copy the nightly build script found in /opt/onbld/bin into the 
    usr/src directory.  

    cp /opt/onbld/bin/nightly .; chmod +w nightly

    In the nightly script there are three places 
    where getopts is called, You need to add a "+" to one or two of them, 
    depending on how you will pass the options to nightly.

    while getopts +inS:tV: FLAG
                  ^
    (This is for if you choose to pass options from the command line)

    and

    while getopts +AaBCDdFfGIilMmNnOoPpRrS:TtUuWwXxz FLAG $NIGHTLY_OPTIONS
                  ^
    (You add here if you will pass your options thru the NIGHTLY_OPTIONS 
    variable. This is probably the one most of you will use.)

    If you choose not to set these, you will see warning messages 
    regarding building tools. It won't affect your build otherwise. 

 4. run: ./nightly developer.sh
    To build the source in the repository.
 
    If you do not wish to do a bringover as part of the nightly run,
    include the -n option.

    ./nightly -n developer.sh
