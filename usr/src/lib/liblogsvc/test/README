# README - testing procedures for liblogsvc logging service library
#

Purpose
-------
Provides steps for testing liblogsvc library

Wish list
---------
Create dedicated test driver for testing C language API

Prerequisites
-------------
Since at the time being there is no dedicated test driver
for testing liblogsvc API, it is necessary to take advantage of
existing test drivers for other modules which consume liblogsvc
library. Target Discovery test driver will be used.

Creating test environment
-------------------------
[1] Install Target Discovery test driver - available
from official IPS repository
# pkg install SUNWinstall-test

[2] Redirect Target Discovery test driver to use liblogsvc
to be tested (following step assumes it is put in /tmp/
directory):
# export LD_PRELOAD_32=/tmp/liblogsvc.so.1

Test procedures
---------------
[1] Test displaying logging messages to console

# export LS_DEST=1
# export LS_DBG_LVL=4
# /opt/install-test/bin/test_td -dv

* Expected result
Messages with "<TDDM_I" prefix should be displayed to the console

[2] Test capturing logging messages to default file /tmp/install_log

# export LS_DEST=2
# export LS_DBG_LVL=4
# /opt/install-test/bin/test_td -dv

* Expected result
Messages with "<TDDM_I" prefix should be seen in /tmp/install_log file

[3] Test capturing logging messages to other than default file
    (e.g. /tmp/my_log)

# export LS_DEST=2
# export LS_DBG_LVL=4
# export LS_FILE=/tmp/my_log
# /opt/install-test/bin/test_td -dv

* Expected result
Messages with "<TDDM_I" prefix should be seen in /tmp/my_log file

[4] Test setting logging level

# export LS_DEST=1
# export LS_DBG_LVL=4
# /opt/install-test/bin/test_td -dv

* Expected result
Messages with "<TDDM_I" prefix should be displayed to the console

# export LS_DBG_LVL=1
# /opt/install-test/bin/test_td -dv

* Expected result
No debug messages with "<TD" prefix should be displayed to the console
