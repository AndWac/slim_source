Disk


This panel displays the internal disks, external disks, and solid-state drives that are available on the system. This panel also displays the size of each disk in gigabytes. This panel enables you to choose a disk for the installation. 

Note: In order to be recognized by the installer, the disks and solid-state drives must be turned on at the time the computer boots. 


Guidelines

	* Recommended minimum size for the OpenSolaris OS installation is displayed. Disks that are too small for a successful installation are labeled as such. 

Recommended size is at least 10 GB. 

	* Manual control of the OpenSolaris file system layout is not supported. During the installation,the Solaris fdisk partition is reformatted with a default ZFS file system layout. All existing file systems on the Solaris partition are destroyed. For details, see the Default ZFS Filesystem Layout section below.
 

Procedure

1. Select a disk.

	* For details about a disk, move the cursor over the disk icon. A popup window provides disk specifications.

2. After a disk has been selected, choose one of the following two options:

	* Install the OpenSolaris OS on the whole disk.

	WARNING: This option erases the existing disk. The entire disk is overwritten with the new OpenSolaris OS. 

	* Install the OpenSolaris OS on a partition on the selected disk. For this option, one existing Solaris partition must be available as the target for the installation.

	Note the following partitioning guidelines:

	*Only one Solaris partition is allowed. You can change an existing Solaris partition to another partition type.

	* Only x86 based systems can be partitioned. 

	* Manual control of Solaris partitioning and of file system layout is not supported.

3. If you choose to install the OpenSolaris OS on a partition, you can resize existing partitions, delete partitions, and create new partitions in this panel. 

	Note the following guidelines:

	* This panel displays the existing disk partitioning. 

	WARNING: If the existing partition table cannot be read, a warning is displayed, and the panel displays proposed partitioning. In this case, all data on the disk is destroyed.

	* The partitions are displayed in physically sequential order as they are laid out on the disk. 

	WARNING: Resizing a partition destroys the data on that partition and all physically subsequent partitions. Existing data is not moved to conform to a new partition layout. However, resizing the last partition or adding a new partition does not affect the data that already exists in other partitions.


Default ZFS Filesystem Layout

The Slim installation uses a previously-created Solaris fdisk partition to create a ZFS storage pool. The ZFS pool includes an /usr file system, an /opt file system, an /export file system, and others. Swap is located on a ZFS volume (zvol) in the storage pool.

If a second disk is available, you can, after the installation, add a second disk to the ZFS pool to create a mirrored configuration. To create a mirrored configuration, use the ZFS attach command to add a second disk to the storage pool. For example:

# zpool attach tank c0t2d0s0 c0t4d0

The following example illustrates a ZFS file system with a non-redundant configuration:

<Indiana-build>zpool status
>> pool: mypool
>> state: ONLINE
>> scrub: scrub completed with 0 errors on Wed Sep 26 23:41:40 2007
>> config:
>>
>> NAME STATE READ WRITE CKSUM
>> mypool ONLINE 0 0 0
>> ONLINE 0 0 0
>> c3t0d0s0 ONLINE 0 0 0
>>
>> errors: No known data errors
