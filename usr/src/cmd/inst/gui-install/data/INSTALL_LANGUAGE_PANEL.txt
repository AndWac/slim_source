Language

The panel enables you to select the language support to be installed for your system. All languages that are available for your system are displayed.


Definition

	Language support provides input methods for the language of your choice, and country-specific symbols, for system-input methods on the installed system. For example, the following are provided in the language of your choice in the installed system:

	* Text entry 
	* Date and time formats
	* Currency symbols
	* Other language and location-sensitive settings 

	Language support also includes system translations for the most commonly-used languages, the same languages that are available for this installer. For example, installing English and French also installs the system translations for other commonly-used languages. If the user sets a less-commonly used language as their default language, English is used for system messages.


Guidelines

	* You can select multiple languages. Then, select one of these languages as your default language.

	The default selections are the installer language and the native languages for the country selected in the Timezone panel.

	The Default Language dropdown displays all valid specfic language and country options for the selected languages and selected country. For example, specific options for an English-speaking country might include English (UK), English (US), or English (Malta).

	* You can select all languages or deselect all languages.
	
	English C/POSIX is always installed. If you deselect all languages, the Default language dropdown is automatically set to English C/POSIX.

	* You can use the reset button to restore the panel to the initial default settings.
