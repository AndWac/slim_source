Welcome to the OpenIndiana Installer


This screen enables you to initiate an interactive installation of the OpenIndiana Operating System (OS).

CAUTION: This installation overwrites the whole disk if one of the following is true.
		a) You are installing to the whole disk.
		b) The disk was not previously partitioned.
However, if you choose to install to a Solaris partition on the disk, the installation can be set to overwrite only that partition. Other existing partitions need not be changed. 

To view the online help for any screen in this installer, select the Help, "?", button on that installer panel. For complete installation instructions, select the Getting Started With OpenIndiana icon on the Live CD desktop and refer to the section in that Getting Started document that covers installing to your system. This Getting Started document also includes a link to the current Release Notes. 

CAUTION: This installation does not upgrade an existing OpenIndiana OS. Instead, this installation of the OpenIndiana OS overwrites an existing OpenIndiana OS with the new version of the OpenIndiana OS. If you want to upgrade an existing OpenIndiana OS, use the pkg(1) command or the Package Manager application instead of this installer. For upgrade instructions, select the Getting Started With OpenIndiana icon on the Live CD desktop, and refer to the section in that Getting Started document that covers upgrading your system. 

Note: You can choose to end the installation on any panel by selecting the Quit button.
