# The list is built of owner-group combinations.  ROOT.SYS occurs twice
# because some directories owned by root and in group sys are subdirectories
# of directories having other owner-group attributes.
#
# It is easier to think in terms of directory names without the ROOT macro
# prefix.  ROOTDIRS is TARGETDIRS with ROOT prefixes.  It is necessary
# to work with ROOT prefixes when controlling conditional assignments.
