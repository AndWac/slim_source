Disk


This panel displays the internal disks, external disks, and solid-state drives that are available on the system. This panel also displays the size of each disk in gigabytes. This panel enables you to choose a disk, or partition on a disk, for the installation. 

Note: In order to be recognized by the installer, the disks and solid-state drives must be plugged in when the installer begins. 


Guidelines

	* Recommended size and minimum size for the OpenSolaris OS installation are displayed. Disks that are too small for a successful installation are labeled as such. 

	* A maximum of 2TB on a disk or on a partition is usable for installing the OpenSolaris release, even if the disk or partition is larger than 2 TB.

	* Manual control of the OpenSolaris file system layout is not supported. During the installation, the Solaris fdisk partition is reformatted with a default ZFS file system layout. All existing file systems on the Solaris partition are destroyed. For details, see the Default ZFS File System Layout section below.
 

Procedure

1. Select a disk.

	* For details about a disk, move the cursor over the disk icon. A popup window provides disk specifications.

2. After a disk has been selected, choose one of the following two options:

	Option 1: Install the OpenSolaris OS on the whole disk.
	
	WARNING: This option erases the existing disk. The entire disk is overwritten with the new OpenSolaris OS. 

	Option 2: Install the OpenSolaris OS on a partition on the selected disk. If you select this option, the panel displays the existing disk partitioning.

	WARNING:  If the existing partition table cannot be read, a warning is displayed, and the panel displays proposed partitioning. In this case, all data on the disk is destroyed.
	
	If you choose to install the OpenSolaris OS on a partition, you can resize existing Solaris partitions, delete partitions, and create new partitions in this panel. For this option, one existing Solaris partition must be available as the target of the installation. 

	If you choose to install the OpenSolaris OS on a partition, note the following guidelines:

	* Only one Solaris partition is allowed. If an existing Solaris partition is available, that Solaris partition will be the target for the installation. Or, if you do not have an existing Solaris partition, you can change any existing partition to a Solaris partition. 

	WARNING: The partitions are displayed in physically sequential order as they are laid out on the disk. Resizing a Solaris partition destroys the data on that partition and all physically subsequent partitions. Existing data is not moved to conform to a new partition layout. However, resizing the last partition or appending a new partition does not affect the data that already exists in other partitions. Non-Solaris partitions cannot be resized.

	WARNING: To make additional space available, you can change an existing partition to Unused. However, if you change an existing partition to Unused, all subsequent non-Solaris partitions are also changed to Unused.

	* If you used a third-party partitioning tool such as GParted, then the
Disk panel displays a partition named Linux-swap on which you can install
the OpenSolaris OS.In this panel, use the dropdown list for the Linux-swap partition name to
change the partition name to Solaris.

Default ZFS File System Layout

The installation uses a Solaris fdisk partition to create a ZFS storage pool. 

If a second disk is available, you can, after the installed system has been booted, add a second disk to the ZFS pool to create a mirrored configuration. To create a mirrored configuration, use the ZFS attach command to add a second disk to the storage pool. For example:

zpool attach rpool c0t2d0s0 c0t4d0s0

The following example illustrates a ZFS file system setup with a
redundant configuration: 

# zpool status
pool: rpool
state: ONLINE
scrub: none requested
config:
NAME     STATE  READ WRITE CKSUM
rpool    ONLINE 0    0     0
mirror   ONLINE 0    0     0
c0t2d0s0 ONLINE 0    0     0
c0t4d0s0 ONLINE 0    0     0
errors: No known data errors
