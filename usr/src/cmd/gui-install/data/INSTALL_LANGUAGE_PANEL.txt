Locale


This panel enables you to select language support and locale. These  
selections determine the language support, the default date and time, 
and other data formats for the installed system.

Guidelines

* You can accept the default language selection or change the selection.

* A language selection is required. You can select "no default language
support."

* The language chosen automatically determines the available locales 
in the dropdown box. Only one locale can be selected.

Note: Anytime the user logs in to the installed system, he can change 
either the locale for that particular session or the default locale by 
using the Options button in the dialog box.
