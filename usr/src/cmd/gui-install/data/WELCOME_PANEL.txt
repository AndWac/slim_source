Welcome to the OpenSolaris Installer


This screen enables you to initiate the installation of the OpenSolaris Operating System (OS).

This initial installation of the OpenSolaris OS overwrites the existing Solaris or OpenSolaris OS with the new version of the OpenSolaris OS. If your system is not running the Solaris OS or the OpenSolaris OS, you must perform an initial installation.

	WARNING: Note the following important considerations:

	* The installation overwrites the whole disk layout if one of the following is true:

		a) The installation changes the partition layout. 
		b) The disk was not previously partitioned.

	* If there is a Solaris partition on the disk, and the installation makes no modifications to the partitions, the installation overwrites the Solaris partition only. Other existing partitions are not changed. 

For instructions about using this installer, select the Getting Started With OpenSolaris icon on the Live CD desktop and refer to the section about installing to your system. This Getting Started document also includes a link to the current Release Notes. 

Note: If you want to upgrade an existing OpenSolaris OS, use the pkg(1) command or the Package Manager application. For instructions, select the Getting Started With OpenSolaris icon on the Live CD desktop, and refer to the section about upgrading your system. 

Guidelines

	* You can choose to end the installation on any panel by selecting the Quit button. 

	* If you click the Quit button, a dialog box asks you to confirm cancellation of the installation.
