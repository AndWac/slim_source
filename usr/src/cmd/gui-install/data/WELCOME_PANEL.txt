Welcome to the Slim Installer


This screen enables you to initiate an initial installation of an OpenSolaris Operating System (OS).


Definition of Initial Installation

	An initial installation of the OpenSolaris OS overwrites the existing Solaris or OpenSolaris OS with the new version of the OpenSolaris OS. If your system is not running a Solaris or OpenSolaris OS, you must perform an initial installation.

	WARNING: Note the following important considerations:

	* On x86 systems, the installation overwrites the whole disk layout if one of the following is true:

		a) The installation changes the partition layout. 
		b) The disk was not previously partitioned.

	* If there is an existing Solaris partition on the disk, and the installation makes no modifications to the partitions, the installation overwrites the Solaris partition only. Other existing partitions are not changed.


Guidelines

	* You can choose to end the installation on any panel by selecting the Quit button. 

	* If you click the Quit button, a dialog box asks you to confirm cancellation of the installation.
