This directory contains an XSLT file for transforming old-schema AI Manifests
into new-schema equivalents and a Python wrapper script for executing the
transformation via the xsltproc program.

These files are expected to be of use to QE teams and users who have a number
of custom AI Manifests that adhere to the AI Manifest schema in effect prior
to build 147 and who wish to transform these manifests for use by AI in
builds 147 and later.

These files are not currently delivered as part of any package.
