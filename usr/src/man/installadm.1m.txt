DESCRIPTION

    The installadm utility is part of the automated   
    installer. 

    The automated installer provides simplified setup and 
    configuration for enterprise installations of the 
    OpenSolaris operating system. The automated installer 
    enables you to create an installation service that 
    provides blueprints for specific x86 installations. 
    This service is available on a webserver. Client 
    machines can contact the webserver and review the 
    available services and blueprints, in order to find 
    a blueprint that matches the client's machine 
    specifications. When a matching blueprint, or 
    manifest file, is found, the service installs the 
    client with the OpenSolaris release, according to 
    the specifications in the service blueprint.  


    As part of this process, the installadm utility enables 
    users to accomplish the following tasks:
    - Set up services
    - Set up images
    - Set up DHCP server
    - Update DHCP server
    - Set up  or remove client
    - Add or delete manifest files
    - Start or stop services
    - List services
    - List manifest files for a service
     
SUBCOMMANDS AND OPTIONS
    The installadm command has the subcommands 
    and options listed below. Also see EXAMPLES 
    below.

    
    installadm

    Displays command usage.

    
    installadm create-service [-d] [-u][-f bootfile] 
    [-D DHCPserver][-n svcname] [-i dhcp_ip_start] 
    [-c count_of_ipaddr] [-s srcimage] 
    targetdir


    Publishes the OSInstall service. Only a source image 
    and a target directory are required for basic setup.   
    
    The command provides the following functionality:    
    - Sets up the OSInstall service image.
            - Copies source image to service location.
            - Translates a non-standard distribution to  
              OSInstall service layout.
            - Starts manifest web server. 
    - Creates a bootfile.
    - Creates/tftpboot entries for bootfile.
    - Publishes a default service, named
        _default._OSInstall._tcp.local
    - Registers a default AI manifest with HTTP web   
      server.
    - Registers a default SC manifest with HTPP web 
      server.
    - Adds DHCP macro entries for services published.

    Note the following specifications:
    - As default, both image and service are created.
    - If existing service name (svcname) is provided, only    
    image is created. 
    - If source image (srcimage) is not provided, and  
    target directory contains a valid net image, then new   
    service is created with existing net image.
    - One net image can have multiple services.
    - Multiple net images can use the same service.
    - By default DHCP server is configured. DHCP parameters  
    are provided by DHCP file or entered by user 
    interactively.
    - An already-configured DHCP server on the same system 
    is updated.
    - If DHCP is running on a remote system, updates can  
    happen through secure shell. User must provide 
    authentication.

    -d
    Makes this new service the default service.
  
    -f bootfile  
    Users this bootfile for the service. If bootfile  
    doesn't exist, it is created. If this option is not
    specified, a bootfile is created with a default name.

    -n svcname
    Uses this service name instead of default service name. 
    If a service of this name already exists, user is 
    warned, and new service is created and named 
    <svcname><n>.

    -i dhcp_ip_start
    Sets up a new DHCP server. The IP addresses, starting
    from ip_address_start are set up.

    -c count_of_ip_addr
    Sets up a total number of IP addresses in the DCHP 
    table equal to the value of the number_of_ip_addresses. 
    The first IP address is the value of ip_address_start 
    that is provided by the -i option.  

    -D DHCPserver
    Updates the DHCP server at this address with 
    appropriate macro. Secure shell is used to contact a 
    remote server. User must provide authentication.

    -s srcimage
    Required: Specifies location of source images to use 
    for setting up OSInstall service.

    targetdir
    Required: Specifies location to set up image.

    
    installadm delete-service [-x] svcname

    Deletes a published service. Accomplishes the following:
    - Removes service from the network.
    - Removes bootfile and associated /tftpboot entries.
    - Stops the web server that is running for this 
    service. 
    - Removes the manifest files and web server configuration 
    for this service.   
    - If permitted, removes the DHCP macro for this service.
    Or, advises user to remove macro manually.
    - With -x option, removes the image. If the image is 
    removed, any IP address associated with this image are 
    reset.

    -x

EXAMPLES

    Example 1: Set up a server for the first time. Since 
    the DHCP server has not yet been created, the command
    includes a starting IP address and total count of
    IP addresses.

    Example%  installadm create-service -s /tmp/image/
    OpenSolaris-2008-05.rc3.iso -i 135.134.133.0 -c 5
    /tmp/newimage

    In this example, the terminal displays the progress as 
    follows:

    Setting up the target image ...
    15280 Terminated
    Registering the 
    service _install_service_46503._install._tcp.local
    Creating DHCP Server
    Created DHCP configuration file.
    Created dhcptab.
    Added "Locale" macro to dhcptab.
    Added server macro to dhcptab - hostname1.
    DHCP server started.
    Added network macro to dhcptab - 135.134.0.0.
    Created network table.
  
    The installation net image is created in the 
    /tmp/newimage target directory.

    The progress display shows that the service, named
    install_service_46503, is created. This name is 
    assigned by the installadm utility. A web process 
    runs at the port 46503 for this service.

    A bootfile is created, also named 
    install_service_46503, under /tftpboot. The client will 
    get this file name through DHCP. The command also 
    creates a link to the net image at /tmp/newimage to a
    webserver that is running on port 5555.
    
    The DHCP server and macro is created. The starting IP 
    address is 135.134.133.0. Five addresses are 
    allocated for clients. The command results identify 
    the macro as dhcp_macro_install_service_46503.


    Example 2: Use the following sample command to set 
    up a client that references a specific service and 
    a specific image location.

    installadm create-client -e 0:19:db:4f:db:c8 -n 
    myservice -t opensolaris:/export/solaris/aiproto

    In this example, the terminal displays the following 
    output:

    copying boot file to 
    /tftpboot/pxegrub.I86PC.OpenSolaris-1
    Enabled PXE boot by adding a macro named 
    010019DB4FDBC8 to DHCP server with:
        Boot server IP (BootSrvA) : 127.134.134.1
        Boot file (BootFile) : 010019DB4FDBC8
