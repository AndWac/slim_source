NAME
     distro_const - Utility for creating an image as part  
     of the Distribution Constructor application 

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/bin/distro-const

     distro_const [-R] [-r step] [-p step] [-q] 
     manifest_file
     
DESCRIPTION

    The distro_const utility is part of the Distribution 
    Constructor application. This utility enables users to   
    create an image, using a specified manifest file as 
    the blueprint for the image. 
    
    The overall Distribution Constructor process includes 3 
    basic steps:
    1 - Set up your system to use the Distribution  
    Constructor application.
    2 - Manually complete required fields in the default   
    manifest file. Optionally, the user can also revise the 
    default manifest settings and associated scripts prior    
    to running the distro_constr command, in order to 
    customize the resulting image.
    3 - Run the distro_const command to create an image.
    
    For instructions about each of these steps, see the   
    "Distribution Constructor Guide" in /usr/share/docs. 

    The basic distro_const command with no options creates 
    a full image. The command options enable users to pause 
    and resume the image-creation process at various 
    "checkpoints," thus enabling users to review status of 
    the image and to check for bugs at each stage.
     
OPTIONS
    The distro_const command has the subcommands and 
    options listed below. Also see EXAMPLES below.

    
    distro_const

    Displays command usage.

    
    distro_const manifest_file

    Creates an full image, using the specified manifest 
    file as the blueprint for that image. The       
    manifest_file field is required.

    
    distro_const [-R] manifest_file 

    Resumes building the image from the last step executed.
    The manifest_file field is required.


    distro_const [-r step] manifest_file

    Resumes building the image from the specified step. The 
    specified step must be either the step at which the 
    previous build stopped executing, or an earlier step. A 
    later step is not valid. The step value may be either a 
    number or a name. The step and manifest_file fields are 
    required.


    distro_const [-p step] manifest_file

    Builds an image, but pauses building the image at the 
    specified step. The step value may be either a number 
    or a name. The step and manifest_file fields are 
    required.


    distro_const -q 

    Lists valid steps at which user can choose to pause 
    or resume building an image. This command option 
    queries the Distribution Constructor for valid steps.
    Use the step identification provided by this command as 
    valid values for the other checkpointing command 
    options.
